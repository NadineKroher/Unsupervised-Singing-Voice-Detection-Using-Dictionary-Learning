If the code is useful for you, please cite the above paper.

Note that, the method was developed for audio recordings where the accompaniment of the singing voice exhibits consistent behaviour 
throughout the recording. If you try it on arbitrary instrumentation, it will, most likely return results of low recall and 
high precision.
